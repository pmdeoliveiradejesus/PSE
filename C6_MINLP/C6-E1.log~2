 ** Feasible solution. Convergence is slow and a derivative is discontinuous.
    Largest change in a variable in the constraint is 2.33399078E-09
    and the change in derivative is 36.000000.
 
--- DICOPT: Setting up first MIP
--- DICOPT: Stopped prematurely: hitting limit DOMLIM

      During execution of one of the NLP subproblems or in DICOPT
      during a linearization the Domain Error Limit was hit.
      Reset the GAMS DOMLIM option, or provide better bounds
      so that the non-linear functions and their derivatives
      can be evaluated.

      CONOPT may also raise this error when the derivatives
      are becoming too large. CONOPT will send a message
      to the screen or logfile. Another indication is that
      the number of evaluation errors is less than the limit.
      If in doubt use OPTION SYSOUT=ON; which will echo
      CONOPT messages to the listing file.

--- DICOPT: No integer solution

      No integer solution was found. The relaxed NLP solution
      will be reported.
